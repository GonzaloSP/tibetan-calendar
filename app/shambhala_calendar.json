He is discussed in many of our books including The Life and Times of Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro which related the following:Of Chokyi Lodros many gurus one of the most important was Terton Sogyal. After Patrul Rinpoche passed away Terton Sogyal became a student of Khyentse Wangpo from whom he received many empowerments reading transmissions and pith instructions. Khyentse Wangpo teased and scolded Terton Sogyal a great deal; he hardly ever praised him. After the great terton had moved to Nyakrong where he established his monastery Khyentse Wangpo started calling him Nyakrong Nakrama-dreadlocked black man from Nyakrong. (I think he called him Nakrama because Terton Sogyal had such a dark complexion.) For the majority of his life Terton Sogyal traveled freely around the country as a wandering ascetic. Khyentse Wangpo by contrast directed a vast number of activities and held a position that brought with it enormous merit power and wealth. Yet he too signed many of his writings Manjugosha the Wanderer. Terton Sogyal couldnt understand it at all. Eventually he asked Khyentse Wangpo directly how he of all people could truly describe himself as a wanderer. Its not something you will understand right now replied Khyentse Wangpo. Go to central Tibet towards the end of your life. Then youll understand. As things turned out Terton Sogyal did eventually go to Lhasa. It was there that he became the guru of many of Tibets highest lamas including His Holiness Thubten Gyatso the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and preceptor of the Tibetan government. As Khyentse Wangpo had predicted in the midst of his new and very busy schedule the great terton came to realize how Khyentse Wangpo had truthfully been able to describe himself as a lifelong wanderer and ascetic. In spite of all his responsibilities Khyentse Wangpo had always practiced the Dharma and never indulged in the games worldly people play. For example he never even attempted to be tactful or politically shrewd yet he was held in the highest esteem by great masters scholars members of the aristocracy politicians and the rich. As a result of this realization Terton Sogyal developed even greater confidence in him. I dont know the details or fully understand why but at one of Khyentse Wangpos seats broken samaya caused Terton Sogyal to become so ill that he could barely move. Chokyi Lodro immediately He instructed Dzongsar Monastery to recite Samayavajra and many hundred thousand Vajrasattva mantras promising offerings for the recitations from the donations he collected. He made more offerings to the very best Dzongsar monks asking them to accumulate one hundred thousand Vajrasattva mantras each and even recited a large number himself. As a result Terton Sogyal recovered completely and is known to have declared that he owed Chokyi Lodro a tremendous debt of gratitude. Chokyi Lodro always said that Terton Sogyal was one of his root gurus. They were very close.",

Eventually he asked Khyentse Wangpo directly how he of all people could truly describe himself as a wanderer. Its not something you will understand right now replied Khyentse Wangpo. Go to central Tibet towards the end of your life. Then youll understand. As things turned out Terton Sogyal did eventually go to Lhasa. It was there that he became the guru of many of Tibets highest lamas including His Holiness Thubten Gyatso the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and preceptor of the Tibetan government. As Khyentse Wangpo had predicted in the midst of his new and very busy schedule the great terton came to realize how Khyentse Wangpo had truthfully been able to describe himself as a lifelong wanderer and ascetic. In spite of all his responsibilities Khyentse Wangpo had always practiced the Dharma and never indulged in the games worldly people play. For example he never even attempted to be tactful or politically shrewd yet he was held in the highest esteem by great masters scholars members of the aristocracy politicians and the rich. As a result of this realization Terton Sogyal developed even greater confidence in him. I dont know the details or fully understand why but at one of Khyentse Wangpos seats broken samaya caused Terton Sogyal to become so ill that he could barely move. Chokyi Lodro immediately He instructed Dzongsar Monastery to recite Samayavajra and many hundred thousand Vajrasattva mantras promising offerings for the recitations from the donations he collected. He made more offerings to the very best Dzongsar monks asking them to accumulate one hundred thousand Vajrasattva mantras each and even recited a large number himself. As a result Terton Sogyal recovered completely and is known to have declared that he owed Chokyi Lodro a tremendous debt of gratitude. Chokyi Lodro always said that Terton Sogyal was one of his root gurus. They were very close.",

What follows is a short biofrom The Autobiography of Jamgon Kongtrul (Orgyen Terdak Lingpa was also known as Pema Garwang Gyurme Dorje. He was born into the clan of Ny- in which an uninterrupted succession of vajra holders appeared. His noble father was Sangdak Thrinley Lhundrup. Terdak Lingpa studied with more that thirty tutors including the great Fifth Dalai Lama and from these masters he received the general range of kama and terma teachings of both the old and new schools of Tibetan Buddhism; in particular he underwent various hardships to receive some very fragile transmissions. He pursued his meditation and spiritual practice to such a consummate limit that his realization flourished in conjunction with the four levels of empowerment and he reached an advanced state of accomplishment. At Sha-uk Takpo Terdak Lingpa brought forth some five terma cycles the most important being The Gathering of Sugatas and practiced them in the proper manner. Due to both his own wishes and the encouragement of others he revivified the spiritual teachings of some minor lineages including the Jonang Shangpa Zhije Chod Bodong and others. In particular with regard to the Early Translation School he composed many excellent works the like of which had never been seen before concerning the sadhana practices mandalas and teaching manuals for the kama tradition primarily those of The Web of Magic The Discourse of United Intent and the Category of Mind and the terma tradition including the former and later cycles of the older termas and his own newer termas. Terdak Lingpa taught on a vast scale giving ripening empowerments and liberating teachings. He also founded the great monastic center of Orgyen Mindroling which became a major wellspring of the theory and practice of the Early Translation School. In such ways Terdak Lingpas activities in spreading the teachings through his teachings practice and spiritual projects were unparalleled. As for his students and the custodians of his teachings these included most of the great gurus famed throughout the Land of Snows the holders of the teachings of the Nyingma tradition in eastern Tibet and the masters living in the main monastic seats. He had so many fine students that it would seem that of all the authentic and venerable lineages of the Early Translation School both its kama and terma traditions there were none that did not stem from this master. The protector Maitreya prophesied to Terdak Lingpa that immediately following that lifetime he would awaken to buddhahood in a pure realm as Pem? Gyenpa Namrol Thay?. On a more general note it is clearly attested to in prophetic termas that Terdak Lingpa was Bairotsana himself and would be the final buddha of the one thousand to appear in this eon the buddha Abhimukta or Vairochana.
